           <b>Hello!</b> My name is Narasimhan Ramesh. I am a Software Test Engineer at Qualcomm. I've lived and worked in 
           sunny San Diego for 10 years. My interests include embedded device drivers, black box and white box 
           testing, operating systems and algorithms.
           <br><br>Currently, I am participating in a full stack development bootcamp at the Univeristy of California,
           San Diego. I have dived into HTML and CSS and it's been an exciting and creative journey so far. 
           <br><br>
           The bootcamp has participants from various walks of life - from electricians to healt care professionals. 
           Collaborating with such a diverse group of web development enthusiasts is inspiring. The hands-on, collaborative
           nature of this course is a great learning experience.
